## Why Blogging
You know all the internet platforms that you grow depend on? 
All your friends and families are using it so you are kinda forced to be on it too. 
Well, this blog is my own platform that I don't have to worry about socializing;
I will write whatever I am interested in without worrying who else might be reading or whether if it violates a term of service.

Stay independent.
